# 0x08. C - Recursion
General

        * What is recursion
        * How to implement recursion
        * In what situations you should implement recursion
        * In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
## [0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget](0-puts_recursion.c "puts")
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

* Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.


## [1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](1-print_rev_recursion.c "print_rev")
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

* Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
